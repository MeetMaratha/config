## Installation
To install all the softwares after a clean installation of arch linux, just run the file setup.sh after making it executable.

```
chmod +x ~/config/setup.sh
~/config/setup.sh
```

It will install all the basic softwares like alacritty (terminal), yay (AUR helper), Firefox (browser), nemo (file manager), Telegram Desktop, SDDM (Login Manager), Lightdm (Login Manager), etc.
It enables SDDM with a custom theme.
