Another git process seems to be running in this repository, e.g.
an editor opened by 'git commit'. Please make sure all processes
are terminated then try again. If it still fails, a git process
may have crashed in this repository earlier:
remove the file manually to continue.

(The error was parsed as 35: A lock file already exists in the repository, which blocks this operation from completing.)
